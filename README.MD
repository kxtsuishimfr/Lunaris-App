Hey, I made this app because I was bored of having to search for materials everywhere online. And you are bored too, so Lunaris came to life.

Lunaris is an app made by an editor, for editors. I try to polish every bit of the app to ensure it works as expected, and to give you a good experience. (Hopefully lol)

Lunaris has the following things in it:

-Animations Hub | Download animations for manga style in a fast way, without stress.

-Materials Hub | Download materials for manga style in a fast way, and without having to search the whole Google for something good.

-PNG's Hub | Download PNG's easily without hassle, all have a transparent background so you don't have to deal with removing the background yourself.

-Overlays Hub | Download overlays easily without searching every Discord channel or looking through TikTok for 'that one' overlay you try to find.

-Audio Editing Hub | Edit audio's without hassle using FFmpeg, a tool that offers advanced effects, no more using confusing apps to edit your audios.

Going more in detail, the Audio Hub is advanced as it offers an easy way to add new effects, plug-in and use files that are made through JavaScript, user friendly and well documented.
To further make the Audio Hub more user friendly, you have advanced features such as a timeline for the effects, soundwave bar, effects picker manager, etc. Effects are split into categories to make the UI more pretty.

Hopefully, this app will solve your problems (and hopefully mine, cause I'm the one uploading things on it lol.), also if you have any issues please open an issue within this repository.
